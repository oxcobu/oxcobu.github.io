<h1>Oxford Coding Buddies - OCB
</h1>

<p>OXCOBU is a community of school-aged students in Oxford enthusiastic about software development and engineering.</p>
<p>
Primarily collaborating on Github, there are also in-person meetings and coaching sessions by experienced senior professional software engineers, supporting the scoping of projects, helping with technical issues, assisting with social and communication challenges and broadening intellectual horizons. </p>
<p>
We do not tinker with canned projects merely requiring to follow step-by-step instructions, but do real stuff, with a sensible goal. It can get challenging. It can get frustrating. It can be rewarding - for those who're up to it.</p>
